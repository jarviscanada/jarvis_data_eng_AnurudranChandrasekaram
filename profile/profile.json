  "summary": "My name is Anurudran Chandrasekaram and I am a University of Toronto Scarborough graduate. I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science specializing in Software Engineering and am currently a Data/Software Engineer at Jarvis. Throughout my undergrad, I have learned a wide range of programming topics and languages. I was interested in topics such as algorithm design techniques, relational data modeling, and network security. I enjoy programming in Python, Java, and SQL by creating projects such as an Airbnb database or working on network security coding challenges. During my work terms in CIBC or at Ontario Public Services I have learned to work well in a fast-paced environment and gained experience working in Waterfall and Agile projects. Problem-solving and creative thinking are some of the skills that I want to enhance in and by working on programming projects to create optimal solutions allows me to do that. Currently, I have a passion for data analysis and using that information to deliver business solutions."
