## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created a product that can get the host hardware information as well as all the host's usage information using bash scripts. Those scripts run every minute using crontab. Used PostgreSQL as the RDBMS to store the host's hardware and usage information so we can write SQL queries that can answer various business questions. This project was then dockerized for easy deployment.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App (In Progress): Creating an app that can create, update and delete a tweet using the Twitter REST API. This app follows the DAO design pattern and uses Mockito and JUnit to create test cases for testing the app.
  - JDBC App: This app is a connection between Java and Postgres RDBMS. It uses the CRUD operations using the DAO design patterns.
  - Grep App: Created an app that mimics the Linux grep command written in Java. It takes a directory or file and traverses each file and each line in the file to find a pattern that matches the regex expression given.


## Highlighted Projects
**AirBnb Database**: Created an Airbnb Database using MySQL RDBMS and Java. This application allows users to create an account as a host or renter and be able to host or rent a listing for certain days.

**Matplotlib FOSS feature**: Contributed to a Matplotlib issue by extending a feature that can toggle the visibility of subplots on a graph through the legend handler. This project was worked with a group of 5 people using a Waterfall project methodology. The tools used were GitHub, python, and pytest to create and test the feature.
