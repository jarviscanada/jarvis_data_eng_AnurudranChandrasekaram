**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created a product that is able to get the host hardware information as well as all the host's usage information every minute that are currently on the server. This project was built using docker, bash scripts, and sql. Used postgresql as the rdbms to store the host's harware and usage information so we can write sql queries that can answer various buisness questions.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AnurudranChandrasekaram/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App (In Progress): Creating an app that is able to create, update and delete a tweet using the twitter API. This app follows the DAO design pattern and uses Mockito and JUnit to create test cases for testing the app.
  - JDBC App: This app is a connection between Java and RDBMS. It uses the CRUD and DAO design patterns.
  - Grep App: Created an app that mimics the linux grep command. It takes a directory or file and traverses each file and each line in the file to find a pattern that matches the regex expression given.


## Highlighted Projects
**AirBnb Database**: Created an AirBnb Database using RDBMS by creating tables for a user to create an account as a host or renter and be able to host or rent a listing for certain days.

**Matplotlib**: Worked on a Matplotlib issue by creating a feature that is able to toggle the visbility of sub plots on a graph through the legend handler. This project was worked with a group of 5 people using a waterfall project methodology. The tools used where gitbuh, python and pytest to test the feature.
